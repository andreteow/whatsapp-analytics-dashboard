[2025-03-22, 12:39:47] andre: Hi all. Thanks @60136353888 for inviting me
[2025-03-22, 12:41:24] andre: The startup I co-founded got acquired 2 years ago so I’m exploring new projects to build from the ground up once again 😊
[2025-03-22, 12:41:59] andre: Been researching and tinkering with AI since then

[2025-03-23, 22:26:44] ~ Z: dont use open ai to code 😂
[2025-03-25, 15:25:37] andre: I’m thinking of organising a community workshop that brings together non techies to come together to build their first app. What do you all think ?
[2025-03-25, 15:31:18] Tze Jin Shee: My 2cent. Don’t.
[2025-03-25, 15:31:48] Tze Jin Shee: Ai not there yet. Don’t want to be free labor plus give ppl false hope
[2025-03-25, 15:41:29] andre: Hmm … it’s perfectly feasible to build apps today with current tech. Not positioning this as formal training. More like informal community get together. Thinking 5-10 people
[2025-03-25, 15:49:47] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Onz
[2025-03-25, 15:50:55] ~ Z: Kinda agree 
Need to guide them properly

[2025-03-28, 19:26:00] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Looks wise I kinda prefer tempo
[2025-03-28, 19:26:44] andre: It’s good for team development. That’s its biggest differentiator
[2025-03-28, 19:27:34] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Seem so

[2025-03-28, 21:48:20] Tze Jin Shee: Plus is free.
[2025-03-28, 21:48:22] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Eh Qwen is better imho
[2025-03-28, 21:48:43] Tze Jin Shee: Qwen multi modal still lacking
[2025-03-28, 21:48:55] Tze Jin Shee: Google have better front processing
[2025-03-28, 21:49:14] ~ Z: Only good thing about Google is large context window
[2025-03-28, 21:49:16] Tze Jin Shee: That why Qwen need to do many other model for each specific task
[2025-03-28, 21:49:28] Tze Jin Shee: Only on API
[2025-03-28, 21:49:38] Tze Jin Shee: And it tend to forgot too.

[2025-03-29, 08:06:42] Tze Jin Shee: Is not diffusion model.
[2025-03-29, 08:07:05] Tze Jin Shee: This seem like a auto regressive model
[2025-03-29, 09:18:52] ~ Z: Ya not diffusion
[2025-03-29, 09:19:02] Tze Jin Shee: The more I know, the less I know. It seem like AI world is similar to physic world as well, the real beauty is finding that one Omni model (the math formula that solve everything)
[2025-03-29, 09:19:51] Tze Jin Shee: Once the parameter hit a range, those specialize model actually perform worse than that Omni model.

[2025-04-03, 11:57:10] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Here is the prompt for yoou to try 


I want to create a job directory for Java AI jobs. All jobs must require Java as the main skill, along with any AI development skills related to LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering, generative ai, etc.

Most AI jobs require Python. But I know that as AI advances, it will penetrate the Java market as well...and this directory will be needed. At least that's what I think.

This developer relations job directory (https://devrelcareers.com/) is a great example of what I'm going for (screenshots attached). I'd be happy if we can completely copy the functionality of this directory as our MVP. For this first version, let's focus on these minimum features: homepage with job listings, job detail page, and simple filtering. We can add more complexity later. I'm open to your expertise in making our directory the best for our users. Make the directory design simple, modern, seamless.

Please use React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling. Implement best practices for SEO as that will be crucial for our directory. Try to populate our directory with actual data. But test data is ok too, as long as we know that it's test data.

We'll be using Supabase in the future. Up to you if we need to connect to it now. I think just getting the mockup/UI would be great first. Then we can do DB later.
[2025-04-03, 12:55:40] andre: hows the output?
[2025-04-03, 12:56:04] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Not too bad.

[2025-04-05, 22:26:44] Tze Jin Shee: previous the gpt plugin only give me a template
[2025-04-05, 22:26:54] Tze Jin Shee: didn't know can design now

[2025-04-05, 22:34:07] andre: Yea
[2025-04-05, 22:34:33] andre: Eventually seeing what part of the process can be productised and automated

[2025-04-07, 07:19:30] Tze Jin Shee: @60176743974 u are right on using vscode. Microsoft just block cursor from using their C++ extension and I think more will follow suit
[2025-04-07, 07:52:23] ~ Z: Well it’s gonna affect their business for sure
[2025-04-07, 07:53:03] Tze Jin Shee: Less valuation for cursor 😂 now they need to figure how not to steal Microsoft stuff

[2025-04-07, 18:22:01] Tze Jin Shee: It will output 2-3k okay part
[2025-04-07, 18:22:15] Tze Jin Shee: The last few k word is just junk that keep repeating.

[2025-04-08, 13:59:50] Tze Jin Shee: Vercel and next I presume.
[2025-04-08, 14:00:01] andre: Hey folks! I’m working on a product called The Idea Worth Building Kit—it’s a 3-part toolkit designed to help solo founders validate their ideas before building anything.

It includes:
- A no-cringe guide on how to talk to users
- structured way to track pain signals
- ⁠A one-pager to decide: is this idea worth building?
[2025-04-08, 14:00:19] andre: I’m looking for a few people to review it before I launch—just to get honest feedback and (if it resonates) a short testimonial.

If that sounds interesting, let me know and I’ll send over the private preview. Would really appreciate your thoughts 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-04-09, 11:41:59] Tze Jin Shee: I really don’t like how vercel work
[2025-04-09, 11:44:31] ~ Z: Yes
[2025-04-09, 11:44:37] ~ Z: Pricey
[2025-04-09, 11:56:46] Daniel Cerventus Lim: just burnt my 30 free loveable credits
[2025-04-09, 11:59:56] andre: What happened
[2025-04-09, 12:08:56] Daniel Cerventus Lim: free tier lah
[2025-04-09, 12:11:04] Daniel Cerventus Lim: so things i learn

- simple prompt
- free plans can do a lot but reach limit when you finetuning stuff
- fine tuning the function takes a lot of prompting
- there needs to be a human todo list and a PRD's todo list
- learn to accept saja then fix later 
Now i am trying to see if i am game to sync it over in another tool and see how it goes
[2025-04-09, 12:11:11] Daniel Cerventus Lim: let me fork a version
[2025-04-09, 12:17:36] ~ Z: Have you sync to GitHub?
[2025-04-09, 12:18:12] ~ Z: You can probably clone it to diff repo and setup local environment to do via roocode
[2025-04-09, 12:30:48] Daniel Cerventus Lim: yeah planning to

was going to use cursor for next phrase with @60162958640 but should i consider Roocode @60176743974 ?
[2025-04-09, 12:32:31] andre: So here's what I usually do. lovable is great for doing first draft and front end. but when it comes to debugging, you better do it on cursor/windsurf. save your lovable project in GitHub and then clone it on cursor. Then ask cursor composer to di a full code audit on the entire codebase. ask it to explicitly explain to you each component in non-technical terms and ask it to also remove all redundancies and refactor where needed.  what you will get is a clean code base that you can resume vibecoding
[2025-04-09, 12:33:17] Tze Jin Shee: That a good way. Let me try that I nv think of let cursor do refactor
[2025-04-09, 12:38:14] Daniel Cerventus Lim: This is what I am doing. 

Was challenging myself to do all on loveable.  Hahaha 
But yeah getting harder
[2025-04-09, 12:40:20] ~ Z: So far the only thing that produced  fully working system is roocode for me
[2025-04-09, 12:40:47] Tze Jin Shee: Not even curso?
[2025-04-09, 12:40:57] ~ Z: Haven’t tested cursor
[2025-04-09, 12:41:05] ~ Z: Paid ones that is
[2025-04-09, 12:41:33] ~ Eason Chai - ELVTD: I like cursor or windsurf better because of the flexibility of what I can build. Sometimes if using a platform, you can get restricted to certain things since they are specialized for certain things. But the downside is that it’s better suited for people with prior coding experience
[2025-04-09, 12:42:39] ~ Z: I might pay for copilot instead since they have agents too now and no issues with using native plugins
[2025-04-09, 12:43:24] ~ Eason Chai - ELVTD: However, I heard that windsurf is way better for beginners even without prior coding experience
[2025-04-09, 12:46:45] Tze Jin Shee: Need to do a cost analysis with windsurf and cursor
[2025-04-09, 12:46:53] andre: i vouch for that haha

[2025-04-09, 15:11:04] Tze Jin Shee: I personally think quasar alpha is OpenAI open model.
[2025-04-09, 15:11:18] Tze Jin Shee: It actually quite good as a Gemini replacement

[2025-04-11, 16:55:16] andre: @60164141620 @60136353888 @60176743974  What do you guys think if we expand this WhatsApp community. Add people who are interested in building apps with AI here. Every month we can organise community events/workshops/presentation etc. The focus will be on applying the tech, not just reading about it. Every member we add here should be curated and interviewed first to assess their fit. to keep the community engaged, we also actively remove members that don't contribute. let me know what you all think
[2025-04-11, 16:55:50] Daniel Cerventus Lim: I don’t mind.
[2025-04-11, 16:55:54] Tze Jin Shee: I follow what boss @60136353888 think

[2025-04-11, 16:56:57] andre: the idea is to build an exclusive community so active that people could even be willing to pay to join

[2025-04-11, 16:58:09] Tze Jin Shee: Will try making some TikTok content this weekend on the VLM

[2025-04-11, 17:01:57] Tze Jin Shee: creating AI related content, then join the paid group for community and support :D
[2025-04-11, 17:02:08] ~ Z: Would it be better if it’s on different platform like discord?
[2025-04-11, 17:02:38] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Discord :(
[2025-04-11, 17:03:04] ~ Z: Just saying 😆
[2025-04-11, 17:03:32] Tze Jin Shee: hahaha, the hard truth in malaysia, discord is the free tech support and whatsapp group is the paid one
[2025-04-11, 17:03:37] Tze Jin Shee: coz of the demography
[2025-04-11, 17:03:47] ~ Z: Really?

[2025-04-11, 17:42:35] Daniel Cerventus Lim: @60122531899 

Can we do this. 

1 curate this group first. Once hit maybe 100 pax we open another channel
[2025-04-11, 17:43:03] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Harder to manage alone
[2025-04-12, 08:18:21] Tze Jin Shee: Bytedance just release paper on seed thinking v1.5. Claim better than Deepseek R1. But Bytedance usually don’t open source their model

I’ve tried outsourcing few times 

All turn out from bad to worse 
Their UI is horrible & backend codes are always overly complicated
[2025-04-14, 10:21:46] Tze Jin Shee: So they can keep their job
[2025-04-14, 10:22:34] ~ Z: Some do shitty things like encrypting the source code etc 

Which can easily decoded 😆

[2025-04-14, 18:33:29] Tze Jin Shee: so trump no going to further limit the Nvidia GPU saction to china, mean the current china spec GPU can continue selling. H20 etc
[2025-04-14, 18:34:12] Tze Jin Shee: but now china seem wanna prevent their local company from buying those lower end nvidia GPU, by passing a new law of power efficiency guideline.
[2025-04-14, 18:34:26] Tze Jin Shee: they hint the company should buy alibaba or huawei chip instead.

[2025-04-15, 15:48:59] Tze Jin Shee: Jin Daily AI Trivia: 5 Things Sam Didn’t Tell You About GPT 4.1

- OpenAI will sunset the GPU-hungry GPT-4.5 and replace it with GPT-4.1 (not enough GPU capacity for more training).

- If you're already using GPT-4o-Mini, switching to GPT-4.1-Mini will actually cost you more. GPT-4.1-Nano is cheaper, but the performance isn't as good. So don’t switch just yet. (Free ChatGPT users are on GPT-4o-Mini.)

- The main reason to switch to the GPT-4.1 series is the 1M token context window. The older GPT-4o model only supports 128K tokens.

- The GPT-4.1 series is designed almost specifically for coding and API usage. It follows precise instructions and is optimized for structured tasks—so no more system prompt hacks or yelling at your AI for better output.

- For multimodal tasks (image/video), GPT-4.1-Mini performs similarly—or even better—than the larger GPT-4o model. Great news if you work with multimodal content: costs have dropped from $2.30 to $0.42 per 1M tokens (blended usage). That’s an 82% cost reduction!

PS: personal test, nano is crap. Don’t use it unless u need OpenAI stuff for dirt cheap. 
4.1-mini is around old Deepseek V3 but perform worse than V3-0324.

Token Input Costs (per 1M tokens):

Model                           Cost (USD)
GPT-4.1                           2.00
GPT-4.1-Mini                  0.40
GPT-4.1-Nano                  0.10
GPT-4o                          2.50
GPT-4o-Mini                  0.15
Gemini 2.5 Pro         1.25–2.50
Gemini 2.0 Flash         0.15
Claude 3.7 Sonnet         3.00
LLaMA 4 Maverick         0.50
DeepSeek R1                 0.135–0.55
DeepSeek V3                 0.135–0.27

[2025-04-15, 15:51:02] Tze Jin Shee: Deepseek better
[2025-04-15, 15:51:05] Tze Jin Shee: No need test d

[2025-04-17, 08:45:11] Tze Jin Shee: Jin’s Daily AI Trivia: Which OpenAI Model Is This?

Today, OpenAI unveiled another “O-series” model—right on the heels of yesterday’s announcement of base model GPT‑4.1 (4.1, 4.1‑mini, and 4.1‑nano). The new lineup now includes:
	•	o3
	•	o3‑pro (coming soon)
	•	o4‑mini‑high
	•	o4‑mini

Confused by all these names? Let me break down the evolution of the GPT and O-series models for you:
	1.	GPT‑2 (2019)
	•	OpenAI’s first public release (1.5 B parameters).
	2.	GPT‑3 (2021)
	•	Sparked the AI hype.
	•	Davinci model: 175 B parameters.
	•	Underpins the original ChatGPT.
	3.	GPT‑3.5 (2022)
	•	Introduced the turbo variant and basic browsing.
	•	Marked the start of OpenAI’s subscription model.
	4.	GPT‑4 (2023)
	•	Estimated at 1.76 T parameters.
	•	First multimodal model (text + image inputs).
	•	Free ChatGPT users access GPT‑4‑turbo (text-only).
	5.	GPT‑4o (2024)
	•	“O” stands for “omni.”
	•	Real-time text, image, and audio input/output.
	•	Free users on image/audio get GPT‑4o‑mini; Plus users use GPT‑4o‑mini as their base.
	6.	GPT‑4o Imagen (March 2025)
	•	Native image generation—an alternative to DALL·E 3.
	•	Powers the new “Ghibli-style” image output.
	7.	GPT‑4.5 (2025)
	•	OpenAI’s largest, most expensive model yet.
	•	Available only to Plus and Pro subscribers.
	8.	GPT‑4.1 (2025)
	•	A leaner, more cost-effective spin‑down of GPT‑4.5.
	•	Replaces GPT‑4o in the lineup.
	9.	OpenAI‑o1 (2024)
	•	First “thinking” model with the “O” prefix.
	•	o1‑pro is the priciest, at $150/600 USD per million tokens.
	10.	OpenAI‑o3 (2025)
	•	More efficient successor to o1.
	•	o3‑mini launched in January 2025 for Plus users.
	•	“o2” was skipped due to trademark issues.
	•	Full o3‑pro model to follow later this year.
	11.	OpenAI‑o4 (2025)
	•	Released alongside o3 today.
	•	Currently available only as o4‑mini and o4‑mini‑high.
	•	Includes basic image-transform tools (crop/rotate) for better analysis.
	•	Rumor has it OpenAI rushed to launch o4 to compete with Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen.

Initial Benchmarking:
o4‑mini trails Gemini 2.5 Pro by a slim margin—but it’s significantly cheaper, especially for large-token contexts. If you need robust multimodal performance on a budget, o4‑mini is your go‑to.
[2025-04-17, 08:45:24] Tze Jin Shee: i hate openai naming scheme.
[2025-04-17, 08:59:22] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Hahaha
[2025-04-17, 09:02:51] ~ Z: Wah 04 mini trails Gemini 2.5 pro
[2025-04-17, 09:03:18] Tze Jin Shee: nicer way to say it not good haha
[2025-04-17, 09:03:27] Tze Jin Shee: but gemini 2.5 pro getting slower and slower
[2025-04-17, 09:03:32] Tze Jin Shee: i doubt google making money
[2025-04-17, 09:04:14] Tze Jin Shee: so i will still choose openai over google in term of longevity. U nv know when google sunset their stuff

[2025-04-17, 09:09:25] Daniel Cerventus Lim: The fuck
[2025-04-17, 09:09:48] Tze Jin Shee: i really think openAI hit the KV cache issue d
[2025-04-17, 09:22:10] James Yeang: Google is focusing on integrating their whole product suite to AI, so the money made there is split up into product retention, and higher usage etc in the face of copilot and the likes. I feel there is a higher chance of openAI going under if it doesn’t keep up.

[2025-04-18, 14:04:28] James Yeang: Hi there, James here.  I’m a heavy AI user but mainly just the simple stuff like using Gemini advanced, NotebookLM. If I want to build something it’s a one click way to make a slide deck look much neater. Not build new slides and create them, just clean up the stuff I have with one click. Yes I use plugins and  it’s much faster. But I don’t want to take any time to make slides look nice just dump it on a slide and make everything aligned. Or draw up how I want my slide to look like and it makes all the empty text boxes for me. Content is no problem, but I hate the time I take to make things look nice

O3 is great for coding and math. But for writing better fall back on 4o. Unless using with deep research mode

[2025-04-19, 19:33:14] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Thank you 🙏
[2025-04-20, 13:13:14] James Yeang: Anyone have any recommendations for a super simple AI powered customer lead and relationship management platform? Easy to use is priority over features
[2025-04-20, 13:14:30] Tze Jin Shee: The whole CRM I dunno. But there are chatwoot
[2025-04-20, 13:16:23] Daniel Cerventus Lim: I got one. But kinda work in progress
[2025-04-20, 13:17:48] ~ longlife: What about existing one @60122583481 like HubSpot
[2025-04-20, 13:25:31] James Yeang: I was looking if there was anything simpler
[2025-04-20, 13:34:02] andre: What’s are your needs ? If it’s simplicity, we can create a new app from scratch with AI
[2025-04-20, 13:34:48] andre: Send a short voice note of what you’re looking to build and we’ll spin one up together ;)
[2025-04-20, 13:38:29] ~ longlife: I am looking to start vibe coding was wondering what software I need to put an app together, I have seen YouTube clips but from your experience what is the stack required to publish to the AppStore
[2025-04-20, 13:39:56] andre: a0.dev and then push to expo go
[2025-04-20, 13:40:22] andre: After that you follow the AppStore developer process to publish
[2025-04-20, 13:40:52] ~ longlife: What about supabase etc
[2025-04-20, 13:41:42] Tze Jin Shee: Is supabase right
[2025-04-20, 13:41:45] Tze Jin Shee: A0
[2025-04-20, 13:45:19] andre: Supabase is a backend service, like Firebase. It’s a ready to go backend that store info and lets you write functions that run on the server
[2025-04-20, 13:45:42] andre: All apps need a backend service
[2025-04-20, 13:46:50] andre: https://a0.dev/ is designed specifically to build mobile apps instead of web ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-04-20, 13:49:06] ~ Z: Interesting
[2025-04-20, 13:56:31] James Yeang: My company is a small one with a few major clients. 

My pain is the inability to Track conversations etc from WhatsApp and email . So that latest status is clear to everyone.  

Desired outcome 

management can have a top to top conversation with updated details without needing to be prompted by anyone.
[2025-04-20, 13:58:42] ~ longlife: Interesting I think many companies have this
[2025-04-20, 13:58:54] ~ longlife: I have it too but my one small team so no issue
[2025-04-20, 13:59:21] ~ longlife: Thanks @60122531899
[2025-04-20, 14:00:19] ~ longlife: Will give it a shot
[2025-04-20, 14:03:15] ~ Z: So you need some kind of CRM that keep tracks of conversations & emails in one place
[2025-04-20, 14:13:46] James Yeang: Yes. Something super simple to set up

[2025-04-23, 11:50:56] ~ Mike Chu: I have a couple ideas in my head already and I want to find possibilities on how to do it, I am sure someone experienced here can work on the execution, mind if we set a discovery call?

[2025-04-23, 16:48:34] ~ Z: You know I can’t diagnose anything just from the front end right 
Is there some sort of log  
Or debug mode enabled

[2025-04-24, 12:55:43] andre: Vibe coded an MVP for a UK based client. They wanted a location based gig worker mobile app. This was done in 2 hrs. I believe the potential for vibe coded apps is huge globally. There will always be demand to build new projects. Should I do a live session soon?

[2025-04-24, 12:58:16] andre: Yup haha
[2025-04-24, 12:58:29] ~ longlife: I am have now tried all of it, windsurf, lovable, Ao.dev, not sure which one to settle with
[2025-04-24, 12:59:03] ~ longlife: Also i have two computers can i replicate a project and pickup on another PC ?, without redownliading the files agian
[2025-04-24, 12:59:21] andre: This is using Replit and Firebase
[2025-04-24, 12:59:33] ~ longlife: my coding skill is minimal but i understand the what is what
[2025-04-24, 13:01:18] ~ longlife: What has been best stack for you I imagine you have tried a few ?
[2025-04-24, 13:02:00] Tze Jin Shee: There is no best best stack. each have their own specialization. For general. Just use cursor.
[2025-04-24, 13:03:25] andre: Of course. Create a GitHub repo and pull the project folder to your IDE (cursor/windsurf/ vs code etc). This update your local files with any changes directly from GitHub. After you finish stage your changed files, commit them and push it to the cloud. This uploads your changes to GitHub
[2025-04-24, 13:03:53] andre: Tldr 
1. Pull before you start working 
2. ⁠push after you finish
[2025-04-24, 13:04:15] ~ longlife: so i have to do this everytime right
[2025-04-24, 13:04:31] ~ longlife: it does not directly tweak the git files on the cloud ?
[2025-04-24, 13:05:00] andre: It does when you push. Think of it like save document
[2025-04-24, 13:05:15] ~ longlife: okay i got you.
[2025-04-24, 13:05:30] ~ Z: More like snapshots

Spoiler alert: pretty boring lol ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-04-24, 13:07:41] ~ longlife: lovable and windsurf are different products right one is a code editor and another build out entirely the whole thing. Is this correct ?
[2025-04-24, 13:08:31] Tze Jin Shee: We want lofi andre asmr
[2025-04-24, 13:09:27] ~ Z: Software Development stack really depends on what you are using it for

Stick to the common ones like react / php etc depending on your use case 

Loveable does all on browser + virtual hosted environment, ready to be deployed

Windsurf is a fork of visual studio with agentic features built in that you can test & deploy manually
[2025-04-24, 13:10:11] ~ Z: Make sure to use those mechanical keyboard
[2025-04-24, 13:16:40] ~ longlife: Would you know which of them is the simplest to compile and submit to App Store and Play Store, Tablet and Smartphone resposive design. @60122531899 Ao.dev seems to have an app compiler
[2025-04-24, 13:42:53] andre: for mobile A0.dev is best for mobile apps. Its built for mobile. the others agentic tools are more web based. you can also create with react native (for android) or swift (for ios) on cursor/windsurf
[2025-04-24, 13:44:24] Tze Jin Shee: I think 🤔 gonna be hard to complete Apple App Store requirement by urself especially if u not familiar with the whole development cycle or Xcode. I think u should have no problem on google play store

This is a curated community. We’re mostly non technical folks that build apps with AI. The goal is to go from that idea in your head to something clickable on the web in less time it takes you to learn JavaScript and python. 

Do share a short intro of yourself to the community, where you are at in your AI journey, specific ideas that you wanna build, and your biggest hurdles starting. We’do our best to help out :) ‎<This message was edited>

Was only using cgpt for the most part until the tools started catching up. Now am catching up with AI and wanna start by building an app for my community, similar to Ensim I guess, a place to take the conversation out of FB and into a platform-agnostic app to connect with trusted users and bizs/shops.

The last event was cool and introduced me to Lovable. I guess right now I'd appreciate a quick suggestion of work flow, eg chatprd>lovable>then what? I can self-youtube from there. Many thanks in advance.

[2025-04-28, 19:39:17] ~ samuel: Hi! samuel here, I have a tech/finance background and actually just graduated (somewhat recently), currently working as a software engineer. At the moment, i've recently just started to integrate AI agents into my workflow rather than single gpt usage for pretty much everything from generating docs, explaining third party code and sometimes my own code, and refactoring entire userflows (ai works wonders across multi-module projects, never felt so powerful haha).

 For now, i'm working on an app which allows retail investors/traders to sync up transactions from their brokers to a webapp rather than manually inputting them into a spreadsheet.

Any AI talk tmr by Meta? Asking for a friend
[2025-04-28, 20:18:17] ~ JT: hi everyone, Johnny here
I’m in B2B SaaS sales & have some experience in B2C as well

i just getting started on this AI journey & personally i tried coding and i think i am bad at it, so gave up until saw Andre’s vibe coding vid in linkedin 

am looking into if can vibe code something like glassdoor then would be great for a start for myself

Since then there’s too many new features,  changes released, plus I’ve been reading on Reddit, there are  some better coding models out right now need to catch up again haha 😆

Hi everyone, thank you for having me! My name is Henry, I have Psychology background and pivoting into UI/UX and coding. In my AI coding journey, I am self-learning front-end development and want to dive deeper into AI coding. I would like to build mental health related apps or websites such as apps for people to easily find mental health services, startups or therapy and potentially building my own tech startup. I'm also interested to see how I can help the  community tackle social issues with AI. My #1 blocker for starting out is overwhelm with too much information like tutorials but lack of real-world practice creating something on my own

Hi All, my name is Kaanthan. I am an engineer by training. I spent most of my working time in O&G and later in Data Analytics. I have held roles that help clients with solutions, be it processes or technology. 
I am very new with AI coding. Currently, dabbling with Lovable and n8n. Since I am not a techie, I lack the knowledge and confidence and am looking to learn by doing and from all the good people here. I am ready to help you where I can as well. 
I am looking to build app(s) that can automate processes within the sales or customer success functions. 
I look forward to meeting/speaking/sharing with you. 
Thank you.

[2025-04-30, 18:55:50] ~ 👍: Hi everyone,
My name is Fahmi , a data scientist from Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia, I graduated in BSC in Physics from University of Malaya, currently accumulating 1.5 years of experience in IT industry that involves Ai and data science product, survey analytics,little bit ads analytics.My skills are on API programming using FastApi, buiding web apps using Streamlit and Gradio, Analytical and statistical Programming...I frequently used Chatgpt, Grok, Claude, and Mistral , Source code from Github Documentation ,huggingface and AWS Documentation, I love vibe coding, and I can build mini AI apps with Streamlit in less than a day working hours. My number #1 blocker in building Micro-SaaS is the challenge to do Frontend and Backend, for frontend is very difficult to produce a good UI ,most of the time i found that choosing our template online is the perfect pragmatic way, also for the backend, I dont know where can I freely deploy my backend and integrate it smoothly like right now , i just know supabase to store data, but I dont know where free service like Cloudflare, i have tried this to do services for my backend telegram, but can just do it locally , dont know how to deploy to cloudflare

[2025-04-30, 19:01:23] andre: Welcome Fahmi. You’re probably more tech savvy than most of us here haha. On your challenges on front end your best bet is to get inspiration from sites like dribble and behance, and then using one of the llm to clone the UIs. It does a pretty not bad work. Otherwise copycoder does a decent work at cloning too. https://copycoder.ai/ ‎<This message was edited>

This thread say what we want to say about how vibe coding is getting harder. 

TLDR by grok: 
- Imagine vibe coding like painting with a magic brush. You describe a simple picture, like a tree, and the brush (AI) paints it instantly, letting you create freely. It's perfect for small, fun artworks. 
- ⁠But for a huge mural with detailed scenes, the brush gets sloppy, mixing colors or missing details. You must fix tiny parts manually, which feels less magical. The result is messier than if you'd painted it yourself. 
- ⁠Vibe coding shines for quick, small projects but struggles with big, complex ones, though future AI improvements might make it smoother.
[2025-04-30, 20:02:04] James Yeang: What are your thoughts about vibe coding individual features to keep things small . Then linking them up to be a more complex use case
[2025-04-30, 20:02:19] ~ Z: Cloudflare has other services too from workers, pages, r2 (similar to Supabase) object storage etc 
Mostly has generous free tier too
[2025-04-30, 20:12:19] ~ Z: You can build a full complex system actually as long as you have some knowledge in coding and know when to stop it from halucinating ( based from my experience), and breaking down into smaller task manually)

As for breaking down the task there are boomerang mode in cline / roo code that does simple things 

There’s tool called taskmaster that breaks down the task into smaller sections from your prd file and monitors its development process 
Pretty much all tools like cursor / cline / roocode can use it too
[2025-04-30, 20:18:07] ~ Z: As for project development part 
You can use the ai tools either perplexity / antropics / cursors / lovable etc  too generate one and modify it accordingly ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-04-30, 21:50:30] andre: We’re looking to organise a weekend community meetup this month (May). Gonna be a live walkthrough on the fundamentals of vibe coding and making sure you folks take action to get started on building and shipping your first project. Would like to do a quick headcount who’ll be keen to join in and then we’ll look for a suitable location close to all.

1. fill up your project details
2. Confirm your fundraising brief
3. AI will process shortlist a list of suitable investors based on your brief and their investment profiles
4. You can directly get an intro to the shortlisted VC by sending an email connection (also AI enabled) ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-05-02, 19:18:39] andre: *Lesson 1: Always start with a mini PRD*
Before I asked AI to build anything, I wrote a simple doc explaining the problem, who it’s for, and how it’s supposed to work. I treated it like I was briefing a junior teammate. I told the AI: “Don’t make stuff up.” Because if a founder says they have 50 users, I don’t want the AI pitching them as a Series A rocketship. That doc kept things tight and on track.

*Lesson 2: Don’t guess the UI. Show it.*
I used to just describe how I wanted the app to look. Now? I grab 1–2 screenshots from Dribbble or Behance and paste them straight into the prompt.
“Make it clean like this. Minimal, not corporate.” It sounds simple, but it changed everything. AI responds *way* better when you give it visual vibes to work with.

*Lesson 3: Think like you’re building a team*
I didn’t dump everything into one prompt. Instead, I broke the app into 3 small jobs:
- One AI cleans up the startup brief
- One AI finds matching VCs
- One AI writes the custom emails
Each of them had a clear role and a different prompt. It’s like managing a squad of interns who never sleep.

*Lesson 4: When things break, check the console*
This one was painful. I’d be yelling at Lovable “Fix it! It’s broken!” But nothing changed… until I opened the browser console. Turns out, the error logs literally told me why things weren’t working. missing data, API errors, logic breaks etc. Now I debug with the console open all the time. It saves hours of guessing and gives AI the info it needs to fix things properly.

The new approach cut down development time by 50%. this was done on windsurf. 

This is a local browser based note book. use it to brain dump any thoughts ideas, or clip articles of interest. If things get to messy, you can choose to organise them with a single click. Everything is stored locally and nothing is stored on servers.

One shot with initial prompt:
_"I want you to review the files in @prd . start by telling me what you understand about this project, and then proceed to building it. I want to use Next JS. Before you start, I want you to clarify with me any doubts you have so that you know exactly what needs to be done."_

It confirmed the spec. I corrected any errors in its thinking. Then I gave the go ahead for it to start building on its own

I am Wynce Low, currently running an international school in Puchong for about 9 years. Was in investment banking doing debt capital markets for 20 years (so not young). No experience in coding or technical. Have experience in engaging developers to build apps for us. Hope to build apps with AI ourselves to get to test the idea first. 
#1 blocker for now, could build a basic html app through SuperGrok but when I want to improve further, it gets stuck (SuperGrok or ChatGPT can’t resolve the issues).
[2025-05-07, 10:53:25] ~ CS Low: Example is an aptitude test as attached. However when asked SuperGrok to improve the logic or functionality, it got stuck. Also tried to use ChatGPT to resolve, they seem to know the problem but they fixed the codes, other error message came up and can’t even use the html.  🥲
Would Claude or any other AI tool better at solving the problem? I have subscribed to SuperGrok and ChatGPT, not sure worth subscribing more 😅

[2025-05-07, 11:11:51] andre: Hi Wynce, welcome! The first step in building any app or website is to be clear on what you want it build. it always starts with your brief. Could you describe your idea in detail? The objectives to be achieved, how you see it working (features), and what will the end state look like
[2025-05-07, 11:22:38] ~ CS Low: Thanks Andre. My thoughts as follows: 
Objective to build aptitude test that interviewees can practice. There will be different industries , types (logical, numerical, general etc), and level of difficulty. The app marks the test , provide detailed feedback for each question. The questions bank shall be random , no repeat questions or repeat similar types of questions
[2025-05-07, 11:23:16] ~ CS Low: The current issue is repeated questions and similar types of questions

[2025-05-07, 13:28:16] ~ Lim: Thanks for adding me to the group 😊 Quick intro — I’m Lyness, a former lawyer turned brand agency owner. I currently run a few businesses, and alongside that, I’m deeply passionate about building solutions and launching tech startups.

Although I’m non-technical, I’ve been actively building side projects and internal tools using no-code/low-code platforms, with a bit of help from AI.

Looking forward to connecting and learning from everyone here!
[2025-05-07, 13:48:32] andre: this is pretty straightforward. You build a questions randomiser that takes in a set number of questions from a document that you upload. For a first draft you can use bolt.new. its pretty easy to set up. Ideally your question bank document should be in CSV file so that that its easier to read
[2025-05-07, 13:49:04] andre: welcome Lyness! Whats the next project that you are on to :)
[2025-05-07, 14:27:33] ~ Lim: I'm thinking on building a conversational task management app designed specifically for solopreneurs/small business owners.

Many small business owners, like myself, use ChatGPT or other AI tools to brainstorm ideas, get business advice, or plan their next moves. But after those valuable sessions, there's a gap — we’re left manually adding each task, one by one, into a separate task management platform. It’s tedious and breaks the flow.

I believe there’s real value in a simplified platform where you can think, plan, and act in the same place. This tool will let users brainstorm directly with AI, then instantly convert the conversation into structured tasks — complete with priorities and due dates — and add everything to a task list with a single prompt.

It’s designed to reduce friction, save time, and help solopreneurs move from idea to execution effortlessly.
[2025-05-07, 14:28:26] ~ Lim: Would love to get feedback from my fellow community members from this group! ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-05-07, 14:47:26] James Yeang: I feel it's a nice fun project. Many of the task platforms for SMEs already offer a decent amount of AI. Eg. Todoist premium, trello AI etc. 

If you can come up with an angle that's compelling enough to make people switch then perhaps you have a chance. Good luck with this

[2025-05-08, 13:41:58] ~ Michael Kwan: *Vibe Coding Isn’t Dumb - You're Just Doing It Wrong*
_(A practical guide for shipping apps with AI & minimal pain)_

Vibe coding gets a lot of hate, especially from “serious” devs. But the truth is: not every project needs to be scalable, secure, or architected like it’s going public on the stock market.

Most of the time, you just want to turn your idea into a working app - fast. Here’s how to do it without driving yourself insane. These aren’t fancy tricks, just things that work.

1. Pick a mainstream tech stack (zero effort, high reward)
If you're building a basic website, just use Wix, Framer, BlackBoxAI or any other site builder. You don’t need to code it from scratch.

If you need a real web app:
→ Use Next.js + Supabase.

Yes, Svelte is cool, Vue is nice, but none of that matters when you’re trying to get something done. Next.js wins because it has the largest user base, the most examples online, and AI is most likely to get it right. If your backend needs real logic, add Python.

If you're thinking about building a game:
→ Learn Unity or Unreal.

Trying to vibe-code a game in JavaScript is usually a dead end. Nobody’s playing your Three.js experiment. Be honest about what you're building.

⚠️ Skip this rule and you’ll burn days fixing the same bugs that AI could’ve solved in seconds - if only you’d picked the stack it knows best.

2. Write a simple PRD (medium effort, high reward)
You don’t need a fancy spec doc. Just write a Product Requirement Document that does two things:

Forces you to clarify what you actually want.

Breaks the work into small, clear steps.

Think of it like hiring a contractor. If you can’t write down what “done” looks like for Day 1 or Week 1, your AI won’t know either.

Once you’ve got the plan, give the AI one step at a time. Not “do everything at once.”

Example:
Chat 1:
"Implement Step 1.1: Add Feature A"

Test it. Fix it. Then:

New Chat:
"Implement Step 2: Add Feature B"

Bugs compound over time, so fixing them early saves you from a mess later.

3. Use version control (low effort, high reward)
AI will eventually break your code. Period.

You need a way to roll back. Most tools have automatic checkpoints, but it’s better to use Git. Manual commits force you to actually track progress, so when AI makes a mess, you’ll know exactly where to revert.

4. Provide working code samples (medium effort, high reward)
Don’t assume AI will get third-party libraries or APIs right just from docs.

Before you start building a full feature, write a small working script that does the core thing (e.g., pull 10 Jira tickets). Once it works, save it, and when you start the real task, pass it back into your AI prompts as a reference.

This small step will save you from wasting hours on tiny mismatches (wrong API version, bad assumptions, missing auth headers, etc.).

5. When stuck, start a new chat with better info (low effort, high reward)
The "copy error → paste to chat → fix → new error → repeat" cycle is a trap.

When you hit this loop, stop. Open a fresh chat and tell the AI:

What’s broken.

What you expected to happen.

What you’ve already tried.

Include logs, errors, screenshots.

The longer your chat history gets, the dumber the AI gets. A clean context and clear input often solves what endless retries won’t.

Bonus: Learn the basics of programming.

The best vibe coders? They still understand code. You don’t need to be an expert, but if you can’t spot when AI is off the rails, your projects will stall.

Vibe coding actually makes learning easier: you learn by doing, and you pick up real-world skills while shipping real projects.

[2025-05-09, 11:28:18] ~ samuel: not sure if the math checks out and is cheaper than openai, but u could check leonardo.ai. iirc their pricing model is a flat 9usd/month for X credits and unused credits carry forward to the next month perpetually

[2025-05-09, 11:32:33] andre: I tried leonardo before. Quality not up to par. Retrained models are not super consistent. OpenAI’s image gen model is the best I’ve seen since midjourney. Unfortunately mj doesn’t have official api ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-05-14, 18:22:32] ~ Z: Just use any open api compatible app

I am using via cline / roocode over visual studio good enough for my usage
[2025-05-14, 18:25:22] ~ samuel: oo ill try that out once my subscription ends
[2025-05-14, 18:30:57] ~ Z: Google chrome has recently enforced   browser plugins must be updated to use Manifest V3 with service workers, 

Many of my plugins got disabled and the developers say it’s too difficult to migrate 


I just used cline +  gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 yesterday mention what that plugin does and it coded a whole workable plugin under 10min for about 5usd

Just had to give some feedback on things to modify and now I got a working plugin again ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-05-15, 09:24:34] ~ Michael Kwan: Cool quick video with many good tips. Start at 8:47 for the big picture, then go back to the start. 

Another highlight is 6:48, the "95% confidence" prompt finalizer, telling the LLM not to do anything unless it's 95% confident it knows what you want.

[2025-05-16, 12:08:06] Daniel Cerventus Lim: yes hahaha
[2025-05-16, 12:10:03] andre: What’s the verdict on canvas vs other tools
[2025-05-16, 12:10:28] Daniel Cerventus Lim: actually not too bad
[2025-05-16, 12:10:46] Daniel Cerventus Lim: i am figuring out how to deploy it
[2025-05-16, 12:11:08] ~ Z: Don’t they deploy on their own platform?
[2025-05-16, 12:11:48] Daniel Cerventus Lim: https://testbizmatching.my.canva.site/
[2025-05-16, 12:12:02] Daniel Cerventus Lim: yeap
[2025-05-16, 12:12:29] ~ Z: Wah the ui not bad
[2025-05-16, 12:12:51] Daniel Cerventus Lim: ok, cant get it to work but not too bad
[2025-05-16, 12:14:51] Daniel Cerventus Lim: I'll explain how to connect this business matching game to a database. Since we're working with frontend-only HTML, we'll need to use a cloud-based database service that allows direct connections from the browser.
[2025-05-16, 12:21:47] James Yeang: Any Bolt users here? When I try to ask it to parse a Lazada link it keeps returning wrong prices 80% of the time.  Any tips?
[2025-05-16, 12:23:29] ~ samuel: is this for parsing item prices from the link query parameters itself? or webscraping the content
[2025-05-16, 12:23:56] James Yeang: webscraping.  I don't think the link has the price details
[2025-05-16, 12:24:44] James Yeang: I tried to tell it the correct price and provide a few examples.  Then it seemed like it was working.  Then after 1-2 more attempts, it's clear that it was not
[2025-05-16, 12:25:34] ~ samuel: hmm could try getting the id of the price text and manually ask bolt to target that specific id? sometimes if it’s a relatively huge DOM from the link, it doesnt parse it really well
[2025-05-16, 12:28:27] James Yeang: Any tips on how to do that? To be transparent.  I don't consider myself very technical.  What I did was just went to developer options, and view source.  I could not figure out which was the ID of the price text
[2025-05-16, 12:31:18] andre: Able to connect directly to GitHub ? If yes then can do extra edits on cursor and then deploy on vercel
[2025-05-16, 12:32:53] andre: Try browser mcp. It literally reads website for you. Slightly more advance but think of it as an intern browsing the web for you and doing manual tasks. https://browsermcp.io/

[2025-05-16, 13:30:45] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Yeap. Just tested see what I churns out. 

Cant seem to do database
[2025-05-16, 14:38:09] Kristian Zwart: Awesome I’ve been planning to use for a project for a while. would love to pick your brains about it sometime at one of the meetups. Did you use a MCP or old school direct API?
[2025-05-16, 15:04:27] James Yeang: So I tried this, but doesn't seem to do what I want.  I'm building a system within Bolt.  I want it to look at a user specified item on Lazada/Shopee or whatever website then just record that item's price on a list
[2025-05-16, 15:43:40] ~ Z: I am unsure bolt has mcp 
Never used bolt

Can you save the code to  github and use other tools that has mcp tools?
[2025-05-16, 15:43:53] ~ Z: MCP gives more knowledge context to your LLM
[2025-05-16, 15:44:23] ~ Z: You can use browser search mcp to get the exact info you need 

With cline it’s just a few mouse click to install or you can ask it to install

[2025-05-17, 20:55:07] Melvin Lim: Can repost that message? I can't view because I joined the group later.
[2025-05-17, 21:13:41] ~ Z: Takes more effort to sync your code to GitHub and continue coding with other the agents, since it’s being sync to GitHub there is version controls and you can easily rollback if something goes wrong
[2025-05-17, 21:47:07] andre: Edit: for front end, I’m using v0 now. For product brief I’m using blueprint builder (in house tool) 


My vibe coding stack 
1. chatprd/snapprompt for product brief and prompt design 
2. ⁠lovable for front end and scaffolding 
3. ⁠supabase for backend services 
4. ⁠OpenAI for AI integration
5. ⁠Windsurf for logic and edge functions 
6. ⁠vercel for deployment
[2025-05-17, 21:48:49] andre: GitHub to sync your project across platform made. Changes done on one will automatically reflect on the other when you push changes
[2025-05-17, 21:55:12] James Yeang: Just to confirm..So the next stage eg. Logic will be using the scaffolding eg. On lovable as a starting point because both synced to github? Is that the general idea? ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-05-17, 21:56:35] andre: Connect lovable to supabase and you can run edge functions there too. You can build and run entire apps on lovable without other platforms actually
[2025-05-17, 21:59:03] andre: The reason I transfer to Windsurf is because I felt the logic functions can be better customised on a code editor. 

For a start I highly recommend getting familiar with setting up edge functions on supabase first

[2025-05-18, 18:46:27] Melvin Lim: Interesting. Are you trying to detect if the beads are real or not? 

If so, using LLM you may not get the answer. You may instead need to train your own model with datasets of beads images.
[2025-05-18, 18:51:36] ~ Melissa Lim Shi Hui: No, I wanna detect the type of beads and how many.  It yes cannot use LLM, need to get a diff ai model. Hoping that 1 already exists tho hahaha

[2025-05-19, 11:03:56] andre: It’s pretty magical when you find that you can create apps even when you’re on the go haha
[2025-05-19, 11:08:40] andre: For designing AI apps, keep it simple, follow this framework. 
- can I make it work in a custom GPT? 
- ⁠if yes , take note of the instructions and any custom documents that are uploaded to it. 
- ⁠create a beautiful wrapper around it with lovable and nest the instructions in the system prompt 

It’ll trigger a field to enter your OpenAI api key but it work without cost to you as the developer

[2025-05-19, 15:00:50] ~ Z: Tempolab? 
Looks cool at first 
Output is good
Integration with supabase etc is good
But it will randomly get stuck and errors out and it can’t proceed with fixing the issues by itself

This is all possible thanks to the power of open-source and AI:
- Flux.dev model
- Custom LoRa
- Replicate.com API to make calls to the model
- Ltx Video on Fal.ai for the animation
- Lovable.dev to build the website and UI

[2025-05-20, 15:50:23] ~ G: Hi everyone! I’m ZherG, Yall can call me *“G”*, a university student and also the founder of a new startup called JomBoss, a platform that *helps students gain real work experience by matching them with freelance opportunities, mainly in marketing, content creation, part-time gigs, and web development*.

🧠 My AI journey so far:
I’m new to no-code AI tools, but I’ve been managing client projects and student talent pipelines for the past year. Now I’m exploring how AI can automate and scale some of the processes we currently do manually.

🚀 What I want to build:
An AI-supported portfolio system that helps students auto-generate and manage their own professional portfolio, ideally connected to the client tasks they’ve completed through our platform.

[2025-05-20, 15:58:25] ~ W.: Hi everyone, I am Charles and I currently run a recruitment business. 

My AI Journey: 
I've experimented/dabbled with prompts through tools such as Claude, Replit and xGrok. Haven't really built any substantial yet

What I hope to build:
I hope to strengthen my business by solving recruitment-centric problems. I personally believe the recruitment industry is operationally outdated and I hope to play a part in disrupting the business model

Happy to be part of this community. I look forward to journeying with you guys!
[2025-05-20, 16:10:19] ~ Hakim: Hi everyone, I’m Hakim, a public sector officer with 13 years of experience, mainly in policy planning, with subspecialties in policy planning, project evaluation, performance management, delivery monitoring, foresight, and public sector reform.

🧠 My AI journey so far:
I’ve been exploring how AI can improve the way governments think, plan, and deliver, especially in embedding intelligence into routine decision-making and long-term policy direction.

🚀 What I want to build:
I’m keen to develop AI-driven tools that support better policy execution, sharper delivery insights, and more future-ready institutions. My goal is to help make the public sector not just more efficient, but smarter and more adaptive. *to do more with less*

Looking forward to learning from everyone here and contributing where I can!
[2025-05-20, 16:21:45] andre: Welcome G! Founders start young these days. Let us know if you need any help at all. Most people here have built and also failed (incl me) in their startups. It’s not a problem to fail. As long as you learn from the experience :)

DO 2GB instance is around 12 USD per month. U can make do with 1GB ram if u don't paste huge data via node.

[2025-05-20, 20:49:28] ~ Pascal: Hi Build with AI community

1️⃣ I am Pascal, a KL-based stay-at-home dad with focus on occupying his son’s time with good stuffs (non-AI).
2️⃣ I started my AI coding journey for about 6 weeks (technically, much longer but 6 weeks with some consistency) mostly building websites and learning to tweak their front-end.
3️⃣ Some of my spare time is to build a sales tech stack powered by AI. This is mostly to help senior CxO to get AI powered workflow and teach them and their team to use it. Additionally, I recently tried building an AI agent to scrap for prospects. Mixed results. Next, I would like to build an automated (of course) tutor scheduling system.

On the tutor scheduling system, its probably where I would be pinging the community. Will scope and GPT what I can before reaching out for help.
[2025-05-20, 21:47:12] ~ Stev: Hi everyone, thanks Andre for the invite. Anyway i’m Steven. based in KL, i’m in the events and marketing services industry. 

have been interested in tech since late 90s when i was in the first *dotcom* (auto correct gone wrong earlier)🤕 boom. left and went into other industries after the bust. over the last few years the passion started coming back when i build and manage an internal news portal and a gamified learning platform for a client.  used external talents and obviously has its pros and cons. 

been intrigued by the talk about tech guys and companies using AI to code faster and better. so guess joining this group is interesting as i can explore how I can personally start on the journey myself. 

personally my aim is to democractize learning and development for the underserved community especially kids in rural areas or blue collar workers. 

my biggest challenge is where to start when developing using AI tools and partly finding sufficient time to focus on it. at least this one of my many first steps. nice e-meeting everyone. cheers ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-05-20, 21:52:28] ~ Melissa Lim Shi Hui: Hi everyone 👋 I'm Melissa. Been loving tech since young, cita-cita saya used to be computer engineer.

Fell in love with law ⚖️ and now run a digital law firm!

Techy lawyer so wanna learn coding again (I was told html isn't a coding language and I gotta be ok w that hahaha!)
[2025-05-20, 22:17:38] ~ Michael Kwan: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

Markup is a text encoding system of writing, in other words, it's code.

Therefore a markup language is a form of coding language.

Ehrgooo... HTML is a coding language ✌🏻

(it's still not a programming language tho 😋) ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-05-21, 13:10:54] Thila 42 KL: Hello everyone! Thila here. I run 42 Malaysia, a comp science school focused on peer to peer learning without teachers. My passion lies in both education and tech :)

I do have a decent background in coding but not a developer. Mostly utilise my skills for automation and hobbyist game dev work.

One of the key things I also focus on is upskilling corporate employees and my focus has always been on helping employees with zero coding background to automate workflow, processes and daily problems using tech tools and simple code that can be generated with AI tools

At the moment one of the use case that I am trying to solve for myself is to build an internal platform that i can use to onboard learners to do Python programming on a cloud based environment without having to install anything. Something like what Replit used to offer for students and educators.

Anyway, nice to meet all of you and hoping to learn and help where I can 😄

Multi country propert 
Multi currency support 
Ability to track expenses 
Track due bills and payments.
Tenant communication 
Inventory in the leased property 
Financial reports for tax purposes - later feature 
Signed Leases 

Are you able to share more about yours
[2025-05-21, 20:38:02] ~ longlife: I am sure there are products that do this. However the multi country becomes the a problem to solve  I intent to micro sass this product at a fair price ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-05-21, 21:03:57] ~ leo: Ideally mine is almost similar to what you are doing for your clients. But mine, additional item is serve as somewhat like CTOS for rental* which is tenant past records. Ex: Tenant tier 1 -- if they fulfill some criteria like pay on time, no issue with past units/landlords, etc. 

*Residential or commercial building but planning to start with a simple version with residential first specifically for service apartments/condo in KL Area near to LRT/MRT stations. ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-05-21, 21:38:37] ~ longlife: This is great definitely there is problem pre qualifying tenants
[2025-05-21, 21:58:27] ~ leo: I noticed most landlords put 95% trust to their property agents (this is a scenario for those using property agent from the start).

The problem with the agent is:-
- They are chasing sales. So they rush to close the deal with potential tenants. Then, they will send the tenant profile to landlord.
- But, landlords often make decision based on emotion only by referring from the profile given by agents---whatsapp form like occupation, reason to rent, etc. Some of them will request company offer letter to check/verify the information. The problem with this is it can be misused by anyone, so no guarantee for PDPA cuz everything is based on mutual trust. ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-05-21, 22:06:31] ~ longlife: Yes this is definitely the case.How do you intent to get folks on board for the pre qualification registration ?

A history with computer hardware (assembled my own computer brand in NL long time ago), software usage, ecom, trade and workfloor process engineering.
Interested in getting the most out of software, but never coded anything myself.
Want to know more about AI and how it can be practically used. No concrete idea yet for an app, but open to get inspired 😊 and have some sparring partners.

Hi everyone, my name is Bruce and i work as a Senior Business Development & Marketing Manager in a holding company that is active in many industries (including F&B, Plantation and Mobile Apps and many others)

I’m just starting my journey into building wth AI and have had many unsuccessful attempts at using Claude, Cursor and Google Appsheet. 😅

I want to build applications that can automate certain business processes and also explore ways for my dev team to quickly develop and iterate on our products and services.
[2025-05-22, 14:14:34] ~ Victor Cheong: Good afternoon everyone! I'm Victor, and I'm excited to connect with all of you.

Like Esther and Chin Tat , I'm on a journey of continuous learning and growth. I've spent my career in financial services driving project management, digital transformation, CX and Business Continuity, but what really drives me is exploring how we can use technology—especially AI—to unlock our potential and solve real problems.

I've been experimenting with AI tools to streamline everything from daily workflows to creative projects.  I'm here trying to learn how to build a side gig and successful venture that can replace my full time job . I'd love to share insights from my own experiments and discoveries, while learning from everyone unique perspectives and challenges. 

Looking forward to growing together 😊

[2025-05-22, 16:45:13] ~ Raymond: haha. yes quite related. customers find me usually from google.
[2025-05-22, 16:49:35] ~ Ang Soo Huey: Hello! Ang Soo Huey here. 
I'm a nurse with more than 3 decades experience, a mom of 2 and a cancer survivor. 

Passionate about holistic healing, my practice blends traditional & modern nursing with integrative healthcare, exploring the power of stem cells, aromatherapy with essential oils, light/sound/ touch therapy & movement and energy healing to understand health through the lens of energy, destiny and harmony to support wellness.

As a nursing consultant, I believe everyone deserves effective, safe, practical (ESP) practices and I believe in giving people health options. My journey through cancer and motherhood kickstart my mission to empower others in their pursuit of good health (body, mind, and spirit).  

Whether it’s through science-backed advice or compassionate care, I'm here to guide you toward a healthier balance life.  
There is more than one way to wellness and combination work better! 

Presently using AI to plan nursing curriculum, treatment plans and holiday itinerary. 
Don't know anything about coding. 

Looking to learn how I can build apps with AI to simplify my work, create awareness and educate on wellness.
[2025-05-22, 16:55:57] ~ Ken: Hello, I’m also new to the group @43048608243890 kindly invited me; I just moved to Malaysia after 15 years in china and 10 years in the UK, working in digital marketing and venture capital during that time, I was lucky to be part of 4  m&a deals on the selling side. I’m now studying an MBA at Xiamen university campus in Sepang. Hope to learn more from all of you on AI

Rapid prototyping with AI; I did two soft build with no coding formal experience in a few days that functionally worked perfectly
[2025-05-22, 18:23:05] ~ Jin: Just curious are those prototyping tools like lovable, v0 has any vendor lock in mechanism? Are the code easily export and be use on somewhere else?
[2025-05-22, 18:23:42] ~ Sui Lynn: Hello all, i am novice beginner new to AI. Going through aging process in slomo is not fun. My socmed algorithms keep showing silo contents that so far not yet overlap covering aging , menopausal women , physically active yet beginning to wear n tear or more injuries happening …. I’m looking to use vibe coding to come up with something to address this.
[2025-05-22, 18:23:57] andre: not at all. you can save them on to your git hub and then work on them on any other platform that you wanted to
[2025-05-22, 18:24:35] ~ Jin: Good to know, thanks!
[2025-05-22, 18:24:40] ~ Fakhrur Razi: I struggled with the backend using lovable, any suggestions?
[2025-05-22, 18:25:35] andre: gotta connect your lovable project to supabase. and the prompt the edge function directly in lovable

[2025-05-23, 09:57:53] ~ Wai Hoe: hello, is the June 21st Vibe Coding meetup still on?
[2025-05-23, 10:08:39] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Yes
[2025-05-23, 10:08:43] ~ Raymond: sad im outstation. haih
[2025-05-23, 10:10:04] ~ Wai Hoe: ok, coz i can't seem to respond to the event invite earlier
[2025-05-23, 10:14:49] Melvin Lim: I've been toying with Bolt.diy. Managed to run in my docker. Connected to various LLMs including deepseek. Not very consistent. So far Gemini yields the best but still not as good as Bolt.new despite they are from the same Stackblitz company.
[2025-05-23, 10:15:11] Melvin Lim: At least I can do vibe coding in airplanes 😂😂
[2025-05-23, 10:17:09] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Wei. What machine you running?
[2025-05-23, 10:17:54] Melvin Lim: Apple M1
[2025-05-23, 10:18:27] Daniel Cerventus Lim: Love the machine. Hahaha 🤣
[2025-05-23, 10:18:29] Tze Jin Shee: i won't use a model smaller than 14b for coding actually. plus it lack of token windows for those small model
[2025-05-23, 10:19:19] Melvin Lim: Yes. If connect locally through Ollama and a small model it's even worse results.
[2025-05-23, 10:31:23] Tze Jin Shee: I would recoomend u switch LM studio and MLX model
[2025-05-23, 10:36:10] Melvin Lim: will check it out
[2025-05-23, 11:52:57] James Yeang: FYI free agentic AI classes from Google. https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/startup-school-ai-q2-2025
[2025-05-23, 12:12:05] ~ Ken: [question] so for those of you not making agents, just using the ChatGPT.com dashboard, on the left column, is “projects” how are you guys using that?
[2025-05-23, 12:27:42] ~ Raymond: Manage and categorize topics only
[2025-05-23, 12:28:51] ~ G: Yes, feed with specific documents that I want him to know, so anytime gpt can refer it. The answer will be more specific and accurate that way
[2025-05-23, 12:29:33] ~ Ken: So just file managment? I was getting so frustrated with it
[2025-05-23, 12:30:12] ~ Ken: I thought the chats in a project would “interact”
[2025-05-23, 12:34:10] andre: Undoubtedly the strongest feature of chatgpt right now it’s it memories features. Its ability to pull together context from all your previous chats with it makes it an ultra smart assistant. I have projects for different topics and whenever I work on these topics I always open up new chat in the said projects. It pulls together context and any custom rules and docs that you assigned only to that project topic
[2025-05-23, 12:36:15] ~ Victor Cheong: I am using it ChatGPT projects to do this .

Use Case 1 : Prompt Optimisation 
I create a project example  prompt optimiser and upload files with guidance on prompting

Use Case 2 :  Personal Planning / Personal voice 
I create a project and include my resume / profile / my mission statement . So any prompts or research i do will focus on my personal self . Example if I want to improve my personal brand 

Use Case 3
Industry research , I put in  industry data and research and use this project folder for research . Example I download transcript from YouTube or TikTok on marketing and load it here so I have some sort of expert with focus on the area I designate
[2025-05-23, 12:37:16] ~ Victor Cheong: For projects you can create custom instructions: I prefer Claude over ChatGPT response so I create an instruction asking the project to emulate Claude behavior
[2025-05-23, 13:34:06] ~ Raymond: Ohh so all chats within the same projects everytime we chat they will use all assets uploaded into the multiple chats?
[2025-05-23, 13:35:14] ~ G: U can check with ur GPT memory to see what your ai remember I think
[2025-05-23, 13:49:15] ~ Victor Cheong: Chats within the project will refer to the documents uploaded as one of the source . 

For example if you have a guideline for prompting . You can also ask to enhance the new prompt based on the guidelines you uploaded to the project 

Or if you’re doing a Campaign . You can ask and evaluate versus the brand guidelines in the project

[2025-05-23, 22:23:01] ~ Ken: yes.
[2025-05-23, 22:25:18] ~ longlife: Hi Ken. Any nuggets of wisdoms to share :) to get your first 10 customers
[2025-05-23, 22:39:30] ~ longlife: My product is a property management tool for multi nation properties
[2025-05-23, 22:39:41] ~ longlife: Multi currency
[2025-05-23, 22:51:41] ~ longlife: There is an mvp ready pending the bug testing.
[2025-05-23, 22:52:12] ~ longlife: It was built for 1 customer but would like to see who else it can be useful for
[2025-05-24, 00:07:19] ~ Ken: First 10 who are strangers, go old school friend of friends, one by one, LinkedIn out reach, go to events and conferences, first few are the hardest. 

If it’s built for one customer and you have revenue, reach out to VCs or investors in the space, ask them for intros to their portfolio and investments, be selective but for the right advise you can award equity on a FAST agreement
[2025-05-24, 00:21:33] ~ Ang Soo Huey: I'm playing catch up. So much to check out. Relatives from overseas here for family reunion. Interesting stuff. Thanks for sharing.
